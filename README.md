## Documentation

### Motivation/State of the Art

### Methods

#### AI Algorithms and Architecture

#### Hyperparameters

### Results

#### Performance Comparison

#### Discussion

## Implementation

### Data pre-processing (plot some data, data cleaning, data augmentation, divide data in train/validation/test sets)

### Model selection and Training (Use at least 2 Models and/or different hyperparameters (network size, number of nodes etc.)

### Model evaluation (Overfitting/Underfitting, use Regularization if needed)

### Explanation i.e. GradCam (which input pixels were most relevant for the output decision)
