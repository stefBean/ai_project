## Documentation

### Motivation/State of the Art

    The motivation for our Project is to find out existing methods of Handrwritten text recognision and apply them to a real World use case.
    The final longterm goal would be to find specially marked TODOs in a PDF,translate them to text and then port them to calendar entries
    This project will focus more on the second step of translating handwritten text to computational txt files. 
    

### Methods

1. Keras:
   Using the IAM Dataset
   Dividing the dataset into small letter snippets
   Generating full words out of snippets
   CNN Training

#### AI Algorithms and Architecture

#### Hyperparameters

### Results

#### Performance Comparison

#### Discussion

## Implementation

### Data pre-processing (plot some data, data cleaning, data augmentation, divide data in train/validation/test sets)

### Model selection and Training (Use at least 2 Models and/or different hyperparameters (network size, number of nodes etc.)

### Model evaluation (Overfitting/Underfitting, use Regularization if needed)

### Explanation i.e. GradCam (which input pixels were most relevant for the output decision)
